# Explain the general theme and specific features of your project.
- This is a project that originally aims to either postulate or prove as many propositions in Eucid's book 1 as possible until we reach the triangle inequality (proposition 20)
- In the end, we postulated some of Euclid's and Hilbert's Axioms, proved proposition 1, 2, 4, 6, and postulated proposition 19

# Cite any resources or existing code you used.
- Euclid's Book 1: [http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/elements/bookI/bookI.html](url)
- Hilbert's Axioms: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%27s_axioms]

# Discuss any challenges, or anything you'd like feedback on.
- Representing various geometric definitions and relations completely without algebra, so no measurement of length.
- This proved to be quite a challenge when you need to represent certain elements (such as segments) as equal to another.
- Finding a way to prove the propositions with the correct and succinct types (i.e. not excessively using certain relations such as Point=) was also quite a challenge
- Github conflict was also a bit of a pain, even when we made a separate file (Ngoc.agda) for individual drafting from the main submission (Main.agda)
- Other than the general correctness, it would be great if we can discuss how to better represent some axioms, like Euclid's postulate 2, which was represented in the project as extendsSeg

# Contributions
- Both members equally contributed to proving or postulating most part of the project.
- Proposition 1 was mainly done by Damian
- Proposition 6 and 19 was mainly done by Ngoc
- Both contributed to several drafts of proporsition 2.
- Most helpers for it was done by Ngoc, and the finallized version in the submission was by Damian
